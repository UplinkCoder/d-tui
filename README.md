D Text User Interface library
=============================

This library implements a text-based windowing system loosely
reminiscient of Borland's [Turbo
Vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) library.  For those
wishing to use the actual C++ Turbo Vision library, see [Sergio
Sigala's updated version](http://tvision.sourceforge.net/) that runs
on many more platforms.

Three platforms are available:

* Posix under an X11 terminal (tested on Linux + xterm).  Input/output
  is handled through terminal escape sequences generated by the
  library itself: ncurses is not required or linked to.  xterm mouse
  tracking using UTF8 coordinates is supported.

* Windows console mode (tested on Windows XP).  Input/output is
  handled via Win32 console functions.  (WARNING: CTFE is complaining
  on Windows when referencing std.socket.  I will try to fix shortly.)

* As an X11-style terminal communicating over a non-blocking socket.

Contributions towards supporting other platforms would be *greatly*
appreciated.

This library is licensed LGPL ("GNU Lesser General Public License")
version 3 or greater.  See the file COPYING for the full license text,
which includes both the GPL v3 and the LGPL supplemental terms.


Usage
-----

The library is currently under initial development, usage patterns are
still being worked on.  Generally the goal will be to build
applications somewhat as follows:

```D
import tui;

public class MyApplication : TApplication {

    this() {
        super();

        // Create an editor window that has support for
        // copy/paste, search text, arrow keys, horizontal
        // and vertical scrollbar, etc.
        addEditor();

        // Create standard menus for File and Window
        addFileMenu();
        addWindowMenu();
    }
}

void main(string [] args) {
    MyApplication app = new MyApplication();
    app.run();
}
```

See the file demo1.d for many example usages.


Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks go out to Adam Ruppe for [his terminal.d class](

which greatly accelerated support for the Win32 console.
